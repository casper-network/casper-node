# Developer docs

This [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) collects core developer centric documentation that does not have a good place in the `rustdoc` of the node itself.

If you are new to `casper-node` development, it is recommended to read this front-to-back. Keep in mind that we are still filling out this body of work as we go. As an experienced dev, you may want to refer to some of the sections occasionally instead.

Check for updates occasionally!

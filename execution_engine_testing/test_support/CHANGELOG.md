## [Unreleased]

### Added
* Added `WasmTestBuilder::get_execution_journals` method for returning execution journals for all test runs.
* Added support to load values from a given Chainspec.
* Added static and constants that represent Casper-mainnet chainspec values. These values will change as new ProtocolVersions are added. The current values reflect ones used in the 1.5.0 ProtocolVersion.
* Added `WasmTestBuilder::advance_era`, `WasmTestBuilder::advance_eras_by`, and `WasmTestBuilder::advance_eras_by_default_auction_delay` to advance chain and run auction contract in test environment.

### Changed
* `WasmTestBuilder::get_transforms` is deprecated in favor of `WasmTestBuilder::get_execution_journals`.
* `deploy_hash` field is now defaulted to a random value rather than zeros in `DeployItemBuilder`.

### Deprecated
* Deprecated the `DEFAULT_GENESIS_REQUEST` in favor of `PRODUCTION_GENESIS_REQUEST`.



## 2.2.0

### Added
* Add some auction and transfer test support functions for reuse among benchmarks and unit tests.



## 2.1.0

### Added
* Add further helper methods to `WasmTestBuilder`.



## 2.0.3 - 2021-12-06

### Added
* Added `WasmTestBuilder::get_balance_keys` function.



## 2.0.2 - 2021-11-24

### Changed
* Revert the change to the path detection logic applied in v2.0.1.



## [2.0.1] - 2021-11-4

### Changed
* Change the path detection logic for compiled Wasm as used by the casper-node monorepo.

### Deprecated

## [2.0.0] - 2021-11-01

### Added
* Provide fine-grained support for testing all aspects of smart contract execution, including:
    * `WasmTestBuilder` for building and running a test to exercise a smart contract
    * `DeployItemBuilder` for building a `DeployItem` from a smart contract
    * `ExecuteRequestBuilder` for building an `ExecuteRequest` to execute a given smart contract
    * `AdditiveMapDiff` to allow easy comparison of two AdditiveMaps
    * `StepRequestBuilder` for building a `StepRequest` (generally only used by the execution engine itself)
    * `UpgradeRequestBuilder` for building an `UpgradeRequest` (generally only used by the execution engine itself)
* Provide `LmdbWasmTestBuilder` can be used where global state needs to be persisted after execution of a smart contract
* Provide several helper functions in `utils` module
* Provide several default consts and statics useful across many test scenarios

### Removed
* Remove coarse-grained support and newtypes for testing smart contracts, including removal of:
    * `Account`
    * `AccountHash`
    * `Error`
    * `Session`
    * `SessionBuilder`
    * `SessionTransferInfo`
    * `TestContext`
    * `TestContextBuilder`
    * `Value`
* Remove `InMemoryWasmTestBuilder`.

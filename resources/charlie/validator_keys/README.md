## Validator Keys  

Keys should be created by running (assuming you are in this directory for local path "."):

`sudo casper-client keygen .`

This will create `public_key_hex`, `public_key.pem`, and `secret_key.pem`. 

Note there is no difference between validator keys and account keys.  
The `keygen` subcommand can be used to create account keys. There are also
no explicit certificates to manage. Those needed are automatically generated by the system.

To provide public key for genesis, please send in the results from the following:

`cat public_key_hex; echo`

Output should be similar to this: 

`015567f6e69418cbda61e88c4168b9219c259c36e0281d70aa6eee6607c9ceeba0`

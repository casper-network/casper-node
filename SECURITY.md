# Security Policy
Casper values the independent security research community and believes that responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities helps us ensure the security and privacy of all our users.

Please do NOT raise a GitHub Issue to report a security vulnerability. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please submit a report to security@casper.network as detailed below, preferably with a proof of concept and/or steps to reproduce. 

We ask that you do not use other channels or contact project contributors directly.

Non-vulnerability related issues such as new ideas for features are welcome on GitHub Issues.

# Security Reporting

If you wish to report a security vulnerability, we ask that you follow the following process, which complies with the [Open Source Committee Maintainers Manual](https://opensource.ieee.org/community/manual).

Please report security vulnerabilities by providing the following information:

- PROJECT: A URL to project's repository  
- PUBLIC: Please let us know if this vulnerability has been made or discussed publicly already. If so, please let us know where.
- DESCRIPTION: Please provide a precise description of the security vulnerability you have found with as much information that you are able and willing to provide. 
  - Please remember to include such steps to reproduce as are appropriate, with all relevant details. 

Please send the above info, along with any other information you feel is pertinent to: [security@casper.network](mailto:security@casper.network).

All Security Reports are confidential.

In addition, you may request that the project provide you a patched release __in advance__ of the release announcement. We cannot guarantee that such information will be provided to you in advance of the public release and announcement. However, our Community Manager will email you at the same time the public announcement is made.

The Community Manager will let you know within two business weeks whether or not your report has been accepted or rejected. We ask that you please keep the report confidential until we have made a public announcement.

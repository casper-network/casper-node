# NCTL setup

## Prerequisites

1. bash shell.
1. python3 + pip3.
1. The [casper-node repository](https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node) cloned into YOUR_WORKING_DIRECTORY.
1. The [casper-client-rs repository](https://github.com/casper-ecosystem/casper-client-rs) cloned into YOUR_WORKING_DIRECTORY.
1. The [casper-node-launcher repository](https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node-launcher) cloned into YOUR_WORKING_DIRECTORY.

be `dev` (or your working branch recently forked from `dev`) for casper-node and casper-client-rs, and `main` for
casper-node-launcher.

To find out which branch of the client and launcher are compatible with the current branch of node, refer to
[ci.json](https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/blob/dev/utils/nctl/ci/ci.json).

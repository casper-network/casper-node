//! Effects subsystem.
//!
//! Effects describe things that the creator of the effect intends to happen, producing a value upon
//! completion. They are, in fact, futures.
//!
//! A pinned, boxed future returning an event is called an effect and typed as an `Effect<Ev>`,
//! where `Ev` is the event's type. Generally, `Ev` is an Event enum defined at the top level of
//! each component in the `crate::components` module.
//!
//! ## Using effects
//!
//! To create an effect, an `EffectBuilder` will be passed in from the relevant reactor. For
//! example, given an effect builder `effect_builder`, we can create a `set_timeout` future and turn
//! it into an effect:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use std::time::Duration;
//! use casper_node::effect::EffectExt;
//!
//! enum Event {
//!     ThreeSecondsElapsed(Duration)
//! }
//!
//! effect_builder
//!     .set_timeout(Duration::from_secs(3))
//!     .event(Event::ThreeSecondsElapsed);
//! ```
//!
//! This example will produce an effect that, after three seconds, creates an
//! `Event::ThreeSecondsElapsed`. Note that effects do nothing on their own, they need to be passed
//! to a [`reactor`](../reactor/index.html) to be executed.
//!
//! ## Arbitrary effects
//!
//! While it is technically possible to turn any future into an effect, it is advisable to only use
//! the effects explicitly listed in this module through traits to create them. Post-processing on
//! effects to turn them into events should also be kept brief.
//!
//! ## Announcements and effects
//!
//! Some effects can be further classified into either announcements or requests, although these
//! properties are not reflected in the type system.
//!
//! **Announcements** are effects emitted by components that are essentially "fire-and-forget"; the
//! component will never expect an answer for these and does not rely on them being handled. It is
//! also conceivable that they are being cloned and dispatched to multiple components by the
//! reactor.
//!
//! A good example is the arrival of a new deploy passed in by a client. Depending on the setup it
//! may be stored, buffered or, in certain testing setups, just discarded. None of this is a concern
//! of the component that talks to the client and deserializes the incoming deploy though, which
//! considers the deploy no longer its concern after it has returned an announcement effect.
//!
//! **Requests** are complex effects that are used when a component needs something from
//! outside of itself (typically to be provided by another component); a request requires an
//! eventual response.
//!
//! A request **must** have a `Responder` field, which a handler of a request **must** call at
//! some point. Failing to do so will result in a resource leak.

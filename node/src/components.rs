//! Components subsystem.
//!
//! Components are the building blocks for the application and wired together inside a
//! [reactor](crate::reactor). Each component has a unified interface, expressed by the
//! [`Component`] trait.
//!
//! # Events
//!
//! Every component defines a set of events it can process, expressed through the
//! [`Component::Event`] associated type. If an event that originated outside the component is to be
//! handled (e.g. a request or announcement being handled), a `From<OutsideEvent> for
//! ComponentEvent` implementation must be added (see component vs reactor event section below).
//!
//! A typical cycle for components is to receive an event, either originating from the outside, or
//! as the result of an effect created by the component. This event is processed in the
//! [`handle_event`](Component::handle_event) function, potentially returning effects that may
//! produce new events.
//!
//! # Error and halting states
//!
//! Components in general are expected to be able to handle every input (that is every
//! [`Component::Event`]) in every state. Unexpected inputs should usually be logged and discarded,
//! if possible, and the component is expected to recover from error states by itself.
//!
//! When a recovery is not possible, the [`fatal!`](crate::fatal!) macro should be used to produce
//! an effect that will shut down the system.
//!
//! # Component events and reactor events
//!
//! It is easy to confuse the components own associated event ([`Component::Event`]) and the
//! so-called "reactor event", often written `REv` (see [`effects`](crate::effect) for details on
//! the distinctions).
//!
//! A component's own event defines what sort of events it produces purely for internal use, and
//! also which unbound events it can accept. **Acceptance of external events** is expressed by
//! implementing a `From` implementation for the unbound, i.e. a component that can process
//! `FooAnnouncement` and a `BarRequest` will have to `impl From<FooAnnouncement> for Event` and
//! `impl From<BarRequest>`, with `Event` being the event named as [`Component::Event`].
//!
//! Since components are usually not specific to only a single reactor, they have to implement
//! `Component<REv>` for a variety of reactor events (`REv`). A component can **demand that the
//! reactor provides a set of capabilities** by requiring `From`-implementations on the `REv`, e.g.
//! by restricting the `impl Component<REv>` by `where REv: From<Baz>`. The concrete requirement
//! will usually be dictated by a restriction on a method on an
//! [`EffectBuilder`](crate::effect::EffectBuilder).

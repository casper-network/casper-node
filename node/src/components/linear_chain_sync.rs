//! Linear chain synchronizer.
//!
//! Synchronizes the linear chain when node joins the network.
//!
//! Steps are:
//! 1. Fetch blocks up to initial, trusted hash (blocks are downloaded starting from trusted hash up
//! until Genesis).
//! 2. Fetch deploys of the lowest height block.
//! 3. Execute that block.
//! 4. Repeat steps 2-3 until trusted hash is reached.
//! 5. Transition to `SyncingDescendants` state.
//! 6. Fetch child block of highest block.
//! 7. Fetch deploys of that block.
//! 8. Execute that block.
//! 9. Repeat steps 6-8 as long as there's a child in the linear chain.
//!
//! The order of "download block – download deploys – execute" block steps differ,
//! in order to increase the chances of catching up with the linear chain quicker.
//! When synchronizing linear chain up to the trusted hash we cannot execute later blocks without
//! earlier ones. When we're syncing descendants, on the other hand, we can and we want to do it
//! ASAP so that we can start participating in consensus. That's why deploy fetching and block
//! execution is interleaved. If we had downloaded the whole chain, and then deploys, and then
//! execute (as we do in the first, SynchronizeTrustedHash, phase) it would have taken more time and
//! we might miss more eras.

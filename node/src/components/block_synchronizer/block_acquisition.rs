// BlockAcquisitionState is a milestone oriented state machine; it is always in a resting state
// indicating the last completed step, while attempting to acquire the necessary data to transition
// to the next resting state milestone. the start and end of the workflow is linear, but the
// middle steps conditionally branch depending upon if this is a historical block (needs execution
// state) or a block we intend to execute, and if the block body has one or more deploys.
//
// blocks always require a header & body and sufficient finality signatures; blocks may contain
// one or more deploys. if a block has any deploys, we must also acquire execution effects
// for the deploys in the block (we do this as a chunked aggregate), and for post 1.5 blocks
// we must also acquire approvals hashes (which correlate to which authorized account holders
// signed the deploys).
//
// there are two levels of finality, weak and strict. we first get the block header (which is
// the minimum amount of necessary information we need to function), and then attempt to acquire
// at least weak finality before doing further work acquiring data for a block, to avoid being
// tricked into wasting resources downloading bogus blocks. with at least weak finality, we can
// go about acquiring the rest of the block's required records relatively safely. if we have not
// acquired strong finality by the time we've downloaded everything else, we do another round
// of asking for remaining signatures before accepting the sync'd block.
//
// when acquiring data for a historical block, we want global state (always) and execution
// effects (if any). when acquiring sufficient data to execute a block, we do not acquire
// global state or execution effects. however, we still check for existence of an execution
// effect _checksum_ leaf in global state at the block's root hash as an expedient way to
// determine if a block was created post-1.5
//
// note that fetchers are used to acquire the required records, which by default check local
// storage for existence and only ask peers if we don't already have the record being fetched
// similarly, we collect finality signatures during each state between HaveBlockHeader and
// HaveStrictFinalitySignatures inclusive, and therefore may have already acquired strict
// finality before we check for it at the very end. finally due to the trie store structure
// of global state, other than the first downloaded historical block we likely already have
// the vast majority of global state data locally. for these reasons, it is common for most
// blocks to transition thru the various states very quickly...particularly blocks without
// deploys. however, the first block downloaded or blocks with a lot of deploys and / or
// execution state delta can take arbitrarily longer on their relevant steps.
//
// similarly, it is possible that the peer set available to us to acquire this data can become
// partitioned. the block synchronizer will periodically attempt to refresh its peer list to
// mitigate this, but this strategy is less effective on small networks. we periodically
// reattempt until we succeed or the node shuts down, in which case: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

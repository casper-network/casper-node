## Unreleased (2.0.0)

### Added
* Add `BinaryPort` interface along with the relevant config entries.
* Added chainspec settings `finders_fee`, `finality_signature_proportion` and `signature_rewards_max_delay` to control behavior of the new seigniorage model.
* Add `ttl_leeway_for_upgrade_point_check` parameter to the `[transaction_acceptor]` section of the node config.

### Changed
* All SSE events are emitted via the `<IP:Port>/events` endpoint. None of the previous ones (`/events/main`, `/events/deploys`, and `/events/sigs`) is available any longer.
* `DeployBuffer` was renamed to `TransactionBuffer` along with the related metrics.
* Switch blocks and the creation and propagation of signatures on them are now rewarded.
* Era end reports now record rewards as motes rather than scores.
* Seigniorage model is now independent of the details of consensus (and compatible with both Highway and Zug) and based solely upon block proposals, signature generation and signature distribution by validators.

### Removed
* Remove the JSON-RPC and speculative execution interfaces.
* Remove chainspec setting `highway.performance_meter.blocks_to_consider` and the entire `highway.performance_meter` section.
* Remove chainspec setting `highway.reduced_reward_multiplier`

## 1.5.6

### Changed
* The node will recognise if a pending upgrade is unstaged and will avoid shutting down for upgrade in this case.
* If an upgrade with the same activation point as the current one is detected on startup, the node will immediately shut down for upgrade.
* Reduce chainspec setting `deploys.max_ttl` from 18 hours to 2 hours.

## 1.5.5

### Added
* New chainspec setting `highway.performance_meter.blocks_to_consider` with a value of 10, meaning that nodes will take 10 most recent blocks into account when determining their performance in Highway for the purpose of choosing their round lengths.

## 1.5.4

### Added
* New environment variable `CL_EVENT_QUEUE_DUMP_THRESHOLD` to enable dumping of queue event counts to log when a certain threshold is exceeded.
* Add initial support for private chains.
* Add support for CA signed client certificates for private chains.
* Add a Highway Analysis tool for checking the state of the consensus.

### Changed
* Minimum block time reduced from 32.768s to 16.384s, with corresponding changes to related chainspec settings:
  * `core.minimum_block_time` reduced to `16384 ms`.
  * `core.round_seigniorage_rate` reduced to `[7, 175070816]`.
  * `highway.block_gas_limit` reduced to `4_000_000_000_000`.
* The `state_identifier` parameter of the `query_global_state` JSON-RPC method is now optional. If no `state_identifier` is specified, the highest complete block known to the node will be used to fulfill the request.
* `state_get_account_info` RPC handler can now handle an `AccountIdentifier` as a parameter.
* Replace the `sync_to_genesis` node config field with `sync_handling`.
  * The new `sync_handling` field accepts three values:
    - `genesis` - node will attempt to acquire all block data back to genesis
    - `ttl` - node will attempt to acquire all block data to comply with time to live enforcement
    - `nosync` - node will only acquire blocks moving forward
* Make the `network.estimator_weights` section of the node config more fine-grained to provide more precise throttling of non-validator traffic.

### Removed
* The section `consensus.highway.round_success_meter` has been removed from the config file as no longer relevant with the introduction of a new method of determining the round exponent in Highway.

### Fixed
* Now possible to build outside a git repository context (e.g. from a source tarball). In such cases, the node's build version (as reported vie status endpoints) will not contain a trailing git short hash.
* Remove an error that would unnecessarily be raised when a node includes its highest orphaned block within the current era.
* Short-circuit initialization of block and deploy metadata DB to resolve delays after an upgrade.

### Security
* Update `openssl` to version 0.10.55 as mitigation for [RUSTSEC-2023-0044](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0044).



## 1.5.3

### Added
* Add `deploy_acceptor` section to config with a single option `timestamp_leeway` to allow a small leeway when deciding if a deploy is future-dated.
* Add `deploys.max_timestamp_leeway` chainspec option to define the upper limit for the new config option `deploy_acceptor.timestamp_leeway`.
* Add `block_validator.max_completed_entries` config option to control the number of recently validated proposed blocks to retain.

### Changed
* Change the limit of the `core_config.simultaneous_peer_requests` chainspec parameter to 255.
* Optimize the `BlockValidator` component to reduce the number of simultaneous fetch events created for a given proposed block.

### Fixed
* Fix issue in `chain_get_block_transfers` JSON-RPC where blocks with no deploys could be reported as having `null` transfers rather than `[]`.
* Fix issue in `chain_get_block_transfers` JSON-RPC where blocks containing successful transfers could erroneously be reported as having none.

### Removed
* Remove the `block_synchronizer.stall_limit` node config parameter since it is no longer needed.



## 1.5.2

### Added
* Added the `cors_origin` config option under the `[rest_server]`, `[rpc_server]`, `[event_stream_server]` and `[speculative_exec_server]` sections to allow configuration of the CORS Origin.



## 1.5.1

### Added
* Added the `upgrade_timeout` config option under the `[node]` section.

### Changed
* `speculative_exec` server now routes deploys to `DeployAcceptor` for more comprehensive validation, including cryptographic verification of signatures.



## 1.5.0-rc.1

### Added
* Introduce fast-syncing to join the network, avoiding the need to execute every block to catch up.
* Add config sections for new components to support fast-sync: `[block_accumulator]`, `[block_synchronizer]`, `[deploy_buffer]` and `[upgrade_watcher]`.
* Add new Zug consensus protocol, disabled by default, along with a new `[consensus.zug]` config section.

* The network handshake now contains the hash of the chainspec used and will be successful only if they match.
* Checksums for execution results and deploy approvals are written to global state after each block execution.
* Add a new config option `[rpc_server.max_body_bytes]` to allow a configurable value for the maximum size of the body of a JSON-RPC request.
* Add `enable_server` option to all HTTP server configuration sections (`rpc_server`, `rest_server`, `event_stream_server`) which allow users to enable/disable each server independently (enabled by default).
* Add `enable_server`, `address`, `qps_limit` and `max_body_bytes` to new `speculative_exec_server` section to `config.toml` to configure speculative execution JSON-RPC server (disabled by default).
* Add new event to the main SSE server stream across all endpoints `<IP:PORT>/events/*` which emits a shutdown event when the node shuts down.

  * `reactor_state` indicating the node's current operating mode.
  * `last_progress` indicating the time the node last made progress.
  * `available_block_range` indicating the highest contiguous sequence of the block chain for which the node has complete data.

* Add a new JSON-RPC endpoint `query_balance` which queries for balances under a given `PurseIdentifier`.
* Add new JSON-RPC endpoint `/speculative_exec` that accepts a deploy and a block hash and executes that deploy, returning the execution effects.
* Add `strict_argument_checking` to the chainspec to enable strict args checking when executing a contract; i.e. that all non-optional args are provided and of the correct `CLType`.
* A diagnostics port can now be enabled via the `[diagnostics_port]` config section. See the `README.md` for details.
* Add `SIGUSR2` signal handling to dump the queue in JSON format (see "Changed" section for `SIGUSR1`).
* Add `validate_and_store_timeout` config option under `[gossip]` section to control the time the gossiper waits for another component to validate and store an item received via gossip.
* Add metrics:

* Add `testing` feature to casper-node crate to support test-only functionality (random constructors) on blocks and deploys.
* Connections to unresponsive nodes will be terminated, based on a watchdog feature.

### Changed
* The `starting_state_root_hash` field from the REST and JSON-RPC status endpoints now represents the state root hash of the lowest block in the available block range.
* Detection of a crash no longer triggers DB integrity checks to run on node start; the checks can be triggered manually instead.
* Nodes no longer connect to nodes that do not speak the same protocol version by default.
* Incoming connections from peers are rejected if they are exceeding the default incoming connections per peer limit of 3.
* Chain automatically creates a switch block immediately after genesis or an upgrade, known as "immediate switch blocks".
* Requests for data from a peer are now de-prioritized over networking messages necessary for consensus and chain advancement.
* Replace network message format with a more efficient encoding while keeping the initial handshake intact.
* Flush outgoing messages immediately, trading bandwidth for latency and hence optimizing feedback loops of various components in the system.
* Move `finality_threshold_fraction` from the `[highway]` to the `[core]` section in the chainspec.
* Move `max_execution_delay` config option from `[consensus.highway]` to `[consensus]` section.
* Add CORS behavior to allow any route on the JSON-RPC, REST and SSE servers.
* The JSON-RPC server now returns more useful responses in many error cases.
* Add a new parameter to `info_get_deploys` JSON-RPC, `finalized_approvals` - controlling whether the approvals returned with the deploy should be the ones originally received by the node, or overridden by the approvals that were finalized along with the deploy.
* Support using block height as the `state_identifier` parameter of JSON-RPC `query_global_state` requests.
* Add new `block_hash` and `block_height` optional fields to JSON-RPC `info_get_deploy` response which will be present when execution results aren't available.
* JSON-RPC responses which fail to provide requested data will now also include an indication of that node's available block range, i.e. the block heights for which it holds all global state.  See [#2789](https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/pull/2789) for an example of the new error response.
* Add a `lock_status` field to the JSON representation of the `ContractPackage` values.
* `Key::SystemContractRegistry` is now readable and can be queried via the `query_global_state` JSON-RPC.
* Unify log messages for blocked nodes and provide more detailed reasons for blocking peers.
* Rename `current_era` metric to `consensus_current_era`.

### Deprecated
* `null` should no longer be used as a value for `params` in JSON-RPC requests.  Prefer an empty Array or Object.
* Deprecate the `chain_height` metric in favor of `highest_available_block_height`.

### Removed
* Remove legacy synchronization from genesis in favor of fast-sync.
* Remove config options no longer required due to fast-sync: `[linear_chain_sync]`, `[block_proposer]` and `[consensus.highway.standstill_timeout]`.
* Remove chainspec setting `[protocol.last_emergency_restart]` as fast sync will use the global state directly for recognizing such restarts instead.
* Remove a temporary chainspec setting `[core.max_stored_value_size]` which was used to limit the size of individual values stored in global state.
* Remove config section `[deploy_acceptor]` which only has one option `verify_accounts`, meaning deploys received from clients always undergo account balance checks to assess suitability for execution or not.
* Remove storage integrity check.
* Remove `SIGUSR1`/`SIGUSR2` queue dumps in favor of the diagnostics port.
* Remove `casper-mainnet` feature flag.

### Fixed
* Limiters for incoming requests and outgoing bandwidth will no longer inadvertently delay some validator traffic when maxed out due to joining nodes.
* Dropped connections no longer cause the outstanding messages metric to become incorrect.
* JSON-RPC server is now mostly compliant with the standard. Specifically, correct error values are now returned in responses in many failure cases.

### Security
* Bump `openssl` crate to version 0.10.48, if compiling with vendored OpenSSL to address latest RUSTSEC advisories.



## 1.4.15-alt

### Changed
* Update dependencies (in particular `casper-types` to v2.0.0 due to additional `Key` variant).  Note that publishing `1.4.15-alt` is only to rectify the issue where `casper-types` was published as v1.6.0 despite having a breaking change.  It is expected to only be consumed as a crate; there will be no upgrade of Casper Mainnet, Testnet, etc to protocol version `1.4.15-alt`.



## 1.4.15

### Changed
* Modified JSON-RPCs `chain_get_era_info_by_switch_block` and `chain_get_era_summary` to use either `Key::EraInfo` or `Key::EraSummary` as appropriate in order to provide useful responses.



## 1.4.14

### Added
* Node executes new prune process after executing each block, whereby entries under `Key::EraInfo` are removed in batches of size defined by the new chainspec option `[core.prune_batch_size]`.
* After executing a switch block, information about that era is stored to global state under a new static key `Key::EraSummary`.
* Add a new JSON-RPC endpoint `chain_get_era_summary` to retrieve the information stored under `Key::EraSummary`.

### Changed
* Rather than storing an ever-increasing collection of era information after executing a switch block under `Key::EraInfo`, the node now stores only the information relevant to that era under `Key::EraSummary`.
* Update `openssl` and `openssl-sys` to latest versions.

### Removed
* Remove asymmetric key functionality (move to `casper-types` crate behind feature `std`).
* Remove time types (move to `casper-types` with some functionality behind feature `std`).

### Fixed
* Fix issue in BlockValidator inhibiting the use of fallback peers to fetch missing deploys.



## 1.4.13

### Changed
* Update `casper-execution-engine`.

## 1.4.6

### Changed
* Update dependencies to make use of scratch global state in the contract runtime.



## 1.4.5

### Added
* Add a temporary chainspec setting `max_stored_value_size` to limit the size of individual values stored in global state.
* Add a chainspec setting `minimum_delegation_amount` to limit the minimal amount of motes that can be delegated by a first time delegator.
* Add a chainspec setting `block_max_approval_count` to limit the maximum number of approvals across all deploys in a single block.
* Add a `finalized_approvals` field to the GetDeploy RPC, which if `true` causes the response to include finalized approvals substituted for the originally-received ones.

### Fixed
* Include deploy approvals in block payloads upon which consensus operates.
* Fixes a bug where historical auction data was unavailable via `get-auction-info` RPC.



## 1.4.4 - 2021-12-29

### Added
* Add `contract_runtime_latest_commit_step` gauge metric indicating the execution duration of the latest `commit_step` call.

* Add `state_get_trie` JSON-RPC endpoint.
* Add `info_get_validator_changes` JSON-RPC endpoint and REST endpoint `validator-changes` that return the status changes of active validators.

### Changed
* The following Highway timers are now separate, configurable, and optional (if the entry is not in the config, the timer is never called):
  * `standstill_timeout` causes the node to restart if no progress is made.
  * `request_state_interval` makes the node periodically request the latest state from a peer.
  * `log_synchronizer_interval` periodically logs the number of entries in the synchronizer queues.
* Add support for providing node uptime via the addition of an `uptime` parameter in the response to the `/status` endpoint and the `info_get_status` JSON-RPC.
* Support building and testing using stable Rust.
* Log chattiness in `debug` or lower levels has been reduced and performance at `info` or higher slightly improved.

  * `[gossip][gossip_request_timeout]`
  * `[gossip][get_remainder_timeout]`
  * `[fetcher][get_from_peer_timeout]`

* Add a new event stream to SSE server accessed via `<IP:Port>/events/deploys` which emits deploys in full as they are accepted.
* Events now log their ancestors, so detailed tracing of events is possible.

### Changed
* Major rewrite of the network component, covering connection negotiation and management, periodic housekeeping and logging.

* Add joiner test.

### Changed
* Change to Apache 2.0 license.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
* Introduce fast-syncing to join the network, avoiding the need to execute every block to catch up.
* Add `max_parallel_deploy_fetches_per_peer` and `max_parallel_trie_fetches_per_peer` config options to the `[node]` section to control how many requests are made in parallel while syncing.
* Add `retry_interval` to `[node]` config section to control the delay between retry attempts while syncing.
* Add `sync_to_genesis` to `[node]` config section, along with syncing to genesis capabilities.
* Add new event to the main SSE server stream across all endpoints `<IP:PORT>/events/*` which emits a shutdown event when the node shuts down.
* Add `SIGUSR2` signal handling to dump the queue in JSON format (see "Changed" section for `SIGUSR1`).
* A diagnostic port can now be enabled via the `[diagnostics_port]` section in the configuration file. See the `README.md` for details.
* Add capabilities for known nodes to slow down the reconnection process of outdated legacy nodes still out on the internet.
* Add `strict_argument_checking` to the chainspec to enable strict args checking when executing a contract; i.e. that all non-optional args are provided and of the correct `CLType`.
* Add `verifiable_chunked_hash_activation` to the chainspec to specify the first era in which the new Merkle tree-based hashing scheme is used.
* In addition to `consensus` and `deploy_requests`, the following values can now be controlled via the `[network.estimator_weights]` section in config: `gossip`, `finality_signatures`, `deploy_responses`, `block_requests`, `block_responses`, `trie_requests` and `trie_responses`.
* Nodes will now also gossip deploys onwards while joining.
* Add run-mode field to the `/status` endpoint and the `info_get_status` JSON-RPC.
* Add new REST `/chainspec` and JSON-RPC `info_get_chainspec` endpoints that return the raw bytes of the `chainspec.toml`, `accounts.toml` and `global_state.toml` files as read at node startup.
* Add a new parameter to `info_get_deploys` JSON-RPC, `finalized_approvals` - controlling whether the approvals returned with the deploy should be the ones originally received by the node, or overridden by the approvals that were finalized along with the deploy.
* Add new JSON RPC endpoint `/chain_run_execute` that accepts a deploy and a block hash and executes that deploy, returning the execution effects.
* Add metrics `accumulated_outgoing_limiter_delay` and `accumulated_incoming_limiter_delay` to report how much time was spent throttling other peers.
* Add a new identifier `PurseIdentifier` which is a new parameter to identify URefs for balance related queries.
* Extend `GlobalStateIdentifier` to include `BlockHeight`.
* Add a new RPC endpoint `query_balance` which queries for balances underneath a URef identified by a given `PurseIdentifier`.

### Changed
* Detection of a crash no longer triggers DB integrity checks to run on node start; the checks can be triggered manually instead.
* `SIGUSR1`/`SIGUSR2` queue dumps have been removed in favor of the diagnostics port.
* Incoming connections from peers are rejected if they are exceeding the default incoming connections per peer limit of 3.
* Nodes no longer connect to nodes that do not speak the same protocol version by default.
* Chain automatically creates a switch block immediately after genesis or an upgrade.
* Connection handshake timeouts can now be configured via the `handshake_timeout` variable (they were hardcoded at 20 seconds before).
* `Key::SystemContractRegistry` is now readable and can be queried via the RPC.
* Requests for data from a peer are now de-prioritized over networking messages necessary for consensus and chain advancement.
* JSON-RPC responses which fail to provide requested data will now also include an indication of that node's available block range, i.e. the block heights for which it holds all global state. For nodes running with `[node.sync_to_genesis]` set to true, the range will be the full blockchain, otherwise the range will start at a block near the tip of the chain when the node started running.  See [#2789](https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/pull/2789) for an example of the new error response.
* OpenSSL has been bumped to version 1.1.1.n, if compiling with vendored OpenSSL to address [CVE-2022-0778](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20220315.txt).
* Switch blocks immediately after genesis or an upgrade are now signed.
* Added CORS behavior to allow any route on the JSON-RPC, REST and SSE servers.
* Storage operations are now executed in parallel, the degree of parallelism can be controlled through the `storage.max_sync_tasks` setting.
* The network message format has been replaced with a more efficient encoding while keeping the initial handshake intact.

### Deprecated
* Deprecate the `starting_state_root_hash` field from the REST and JSON-RPC status endpoints.

### Removed
* Legacy synchronization from genesis in favor of fast sync has been removed.
* The `casper-mainnet` feature flag has been removed.
* Integrity check has been removed.
* Remove `verify_accounts` option from `config.toml`, meaning deploys received from clients always undergo account balance checks to assess suitability for execution or not.
* Remove a temporary chainspec setting `max_stored_value_size` to limit the size of individual values stored in global state.
* Remove asymmetric key functionality (move to `casper-types` crate behind feature "std").
* Remove time types (move to `casper-types` with some functionality behind feature "std").

### Fixed
* Limiters for incoming requests and outgoing bandwidth will no longer inadvertently delay some validator traffic when maxed out due to joining nodes.
* Dropped connections no longer cause the outstanding messages metric to become incorrect.

### Security
* OpenSSL has been bumped to version 1.1.1.n, if compiling with vendored OpenSSL to address [CVE-2022-0778](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20220315.txt).

* Add a chainspec setting `minimum_delegation_amount` to limit the minimal amount of motes that can be delegated by a first time delegator.
* Add a chainspec setting `block_max_approval_count` to limit the maximum number of approvals across all deploys in a single block.
* Add a `finalized_approvals` field to the GetDeploy RPC, which if `true` causes the response to include finalized approvals substituted for the originally-received ones.

### Fixed
* Include deploy approvals in block payloads upon which consensus operates.
* Fixes a bug where historical auction data was unavailable via `get-auction-info` RPC.

* Add `state_get_trie` JSON-RPC endpoint.
* Add `info_get_validator_changes` JSON-RPC endpoint and REST endpoint `validator-changes` that return the status changes of active validators.

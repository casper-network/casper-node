## [Unreleased]

### Added
* Add `no-std-helpers` feature, enabled by default, which provides no-std panic/oom handlers and a global allocator as a convenience.
* Add new APIs for transferring tokens to the main purse associated with a public key: `transfer_to_public_key` and `transfer_from_purse_to_public_key`.

### Deprecated
* Feature `std` is deprecated as it is now a no-op, since there is no benefit to linking the std lib via this crate.
